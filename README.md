# Transfer Learning for Different Fuel Sizes

The goal of this repo is to effectively train machine learning models of dead fuel moisture content for more fuel sizes than the standard 10h stick, including 1h and 100h fuels. We will test various transfer learning methods to adapt a RNN pre-trained on 10h sensor data to predict other fuel types.

## Datasets

- Larger Fuels: 100h and 1000h datasets are built using the FEMS API with code originally developed by Angel Farguell and collaborators at WIRC.
- Fine fuels datasets: these data come from small-scale academic studies. Please email the listed correspondance in this document for access to these datasets
